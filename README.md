 Analysis and Impact of Oil price crash and pandemic on Alberta's economy 

During the last two and three quarters of years, everyone has been dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic losses, meaning that all of us has been affected one way or another, if we talk about economy is obviously one of the most impacted metrics is the Oil and Gas industry and this become relevant for Canada and Alberta, as Alberta is the main oil producer for whole Canada, hence, the relevance to look into this numbers is to know if the market, after all this time is recovering.

As for the analysis we are going to divided into 3 parts, pre-pandemic (10 years before), pandemic (2020-2021) and post-pandemic (2022) this to have some point of comparison; the general idea is to find some insights regarding the impact of the pandemic in the oil and gas industry and correlate that with the Gross Domestic Product of Albertaâ€™s people.

Guiding questions
For the project we will look to answer the following questions:
Is there any GDP affectation regarding the O&G (Oil and Gas) industry for the province of Alberta in Canada? 
Here we are going to investigate the contribution of O&G industry to the GDP of Albertans and try to see if is directly correlated to that or any other metric, the objective is to gain insight into how the behavior of one metric affects the other.
Which is the most Albertan economic sector affected and is it recovering after the pandemic?
We will investigate time series identify affected sectors and see which is the one who performed the worst during COVID times (betting that for Alberta is going to be related to O&G) and try to identify if the mention sector can show a positive trend during this year.

How has the inflation rate growth during and after pandemic times? 
Inflation is a metric that has shown a lot of (positive) variability during the last months, changing from 4.8 in January to 8.4 (June highest)1 so the objective of this question is to try to investigate how this change affects the different factors in Alberta, factors such as housing, employment, health costs, business going out of business, etc.
What is the present economic condition in Alberta? 
As for the previous questions we should be able to get all the data and insights necessary to get a bigger picture of how Alberta is doing regarding economic impact after the pandemic.
