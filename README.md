 Analysis and Impact of Oil price crash and pandemic on Alberta's economy 

During the last two and three quarters of years, everyone has been dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic losses, meaning that all of us has been affected one way or another, if we talk about economy is obviously one of the most impacted metrics is the Oil and Gas industry and this become relevant for Canada and Alberta, as Alberta is the main oil producer for whole Canada, hence, the relevance to look into this numbers is to know if the market, after all this time is recovering.

As for the analysis we are going to divided into 3 parts, pre-pandemic (10 years before), pandemic (2020-2021) and post-pandemic (2022) this to have some point of comparison; the general idea is to find some insights regarding the impact of the pandemic in the oil and gas industry and correlate that with the Gross Domestic Product of Alberta’s people.
